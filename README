Pyice is a compiler for the Ice9 language written in Python, using PLY.

It's pronounced in one syllable, rhymes with mice (think pice, rather than pie-ice).

USAGE
./ice9 [files]

Output:
Nothing if compilation succeeds, otherwise an error message on stderr

Requires:
Python, versions 2.4.3 and 2.6.6 tested

Most of the test cases were not created by myself, and all rights go out to their respective authors. Thank you all for contributing the test cases, I don't know what I would've done without them. If there are any issues with them being here, please contact me via GitHub, or at mdwrigh2@ncsu.edu.
